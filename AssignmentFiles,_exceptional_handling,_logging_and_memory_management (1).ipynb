        "memory management Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        " - **interpreted language:** Here , code is executed line by line, and code is converted into machine code without separate compilation steps.Ex:JavaScript, Python (altough its considered a mix of  interpreted and compiled language, as it is desgined for PVM).\n",
        "   **compiled languages:** Here, source code is transformed into machine code by compiler,which can be understand by CPU. Example: C,C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2.What is exception handling in Python\n",
        " - While writing multiple pyhton codes,at times one of the line of code may throw exception , resulting an automatic termination for the subsequent codes. Hence, code is written in a exception block , `try:` and `exception:`  syntex , so that specific error can be caught in an variable contaner, and other codes executed perfectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        " - `finally:` block is written at the end of the code, it is executed at the last, while exception is raised or not, irespective of that `finally:` block code is executed. At times it could be an additional burden for the developer, as it has very limited real time use.But as a best practice developer should use it(e.g. after File operation , under `finally` block, file.close(), can be used).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4.What is logging in Python\n",
        " - Logging in Python is a built-in module ,instead of printing or capturing a error in avaribale, logging module helps to capture the error messages in a separate log file, which makes devlopers ans users to identify the error details and analyis it for further steps. Logging has different level, lowest level is 'Noset`, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, CIRITICAL are other useful levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        " -The __del__ method in Python is a special method (destructor) that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        " - Import is used for modules, and from....import is used for package (from package import the module).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        " - `Exception` itself is a class in python, which contains all the errors in python.In `exception` block, developer can multiple exception blocks to capture different exception. e.g. 1st exception as `keyerror`, 2nd error as `typeerror`etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        " - With statement ensures that file is closed properly after the block of code is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        " -Multithreading: Runs multiple threads  within the same process.\n",
        " -Multiprocessing:Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        " - logging function helps to capture the different steps of the code execution and save it in a separate file, where it can be referred later for users/developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11.What is memory management in Python\n",
        " -Memory management in Python refers to the process by which Python handles the allocation, use, and release of memory during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        " -the basic steps in Python exception handling are:\n",
        " 1) Use a try block to wrap code that might raise an exception.\n",
        " 2) Handle exceptions using except blocks, optionally adding else for code to run if no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13.Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        " -Memory management is important in Python to ensure efficient use of system resources and maintain optimal performance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        " -`try:` block is where developer writte the the line of codes.\n",
        " -'except:`block is where exception is contained and catch in a varibale.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15.How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "# 16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "- `else:` block is executed when `try:` block is executed without any exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17.What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        " - common logging levels are 'DEBUG','INFO','WARNING','ERROR','CRITICAL'.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        " -os.fork():Creates a child process by directly cloning the current process.\n",
        " -multiprocessing:A high-level library to create and manage processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        " - File closing important because, if file is open after code execution, it may incur issues like file locking or data corruption etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        " - file.read(): It block of code can read all the content of a file.\n",
        " -file.readline():Reads a single line from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21.What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        " - Its is used for tracking steps of the code runs,and highlight/captures/reports different steps. sysntex is 'import logging'.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        " - OS module is imported/used to interact with oerating system and performing various operating system-related tasks, including file and directory handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
